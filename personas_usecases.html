        <h2>Student/Teacher</h2>
        <p>John is a 19 year old currently in his 2ยบ year of university. In one of his classes he was asked to work on a group project. 
            For that reason he needs a platform to manage said project, 
            to request specialised equipment, and to coordinate better with his team.
        </p>
        <h2>Technician</h2>
        <p>Mike works as technician at the University and is currently responsible for the equipment and resources available there. He has no IT or engineering knowledge. 
            The software he is using at the moment is outdated, and for more convenient experience in management 
            he needs a program that better fits his skills and is easy to use.
